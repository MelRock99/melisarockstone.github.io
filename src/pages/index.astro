    <p style="margin:0;opacity:.92;max-width:78ch;">
      MelisaRockStone Music comes out of Plant City, Florida, blending blues rock, bayou grit, and southern rebellion into a raw, roots-driven sound. The music is shaped by deep life experiences—hard seasons, survival, and spiritual transformation—turned into songs that carry both grit and meaning. A self-producing artist, MelisaRockStone writes and develops original material using guitar, vocals, flute, and modern production tools while maintaining hands-on creative control. Recording work has taken place in Florida and Morocco, with current focus on new releases, live performances, and continued growth.
